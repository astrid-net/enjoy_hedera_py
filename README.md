# enjoy_hedera_py
Hi folks. Here Astrid, a Data Scientists and Solidity developers team specialized in development of hybrid products including both Blockchain and Data Science. Several big player already appreciate our attitude towards our goals and our approach to our tasks, infact we are official Flux and Ocean Protocol partners. We love to approach new technologies, build new dApps on top of them and enhance their usage through implementation of Data Science.

In this repo, we approach Hedera, an ecosystem with multiple benefits. We will regularly update it with new scripts and explainations. Hope it's useful for some of you!

Since we noticed that there's a pre-existing repo, we switched all code snippets and will implement all further updates on the new one (https://github.com/hedera-dev/hedera-code-snippets) and will archieve this one.
